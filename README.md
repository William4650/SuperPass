# SuperPass

SuperPass is a command-line based password generator that takes a regular Human Readable Password and converts it into a complex string of letters and numbers.

For Example, `superpass -c Password123`

`Password123` becomes `ZgVieEeYPwx8P06LJ2z3QuS9XbVz3QuS9XbV6K7vp91Padk182JSERZMuQarPAuhn9ILdbh4U4mdKuDRwuleOLuwvaSnqs9TTiR`

Then, when you need to access your passwords, input your human readable password into the command-line tool and you have what your real password is.

If you have your complex password, but forgot what your human readable version is simply type `superpass -r ZgVieEeYPwx8P06LJ2z3QuS9XbVz3QuS9XbV6K7vp91Padk182JSERZMuQarPAuhn9ILdbh4U4mdKuDRwuleOLuwvaSnqs9TTiR`.

`ZgVieEeYPwx8P06LJ2z3QuS9XbVz3QuS9XbV6K7vp91Padk182JSERZMuQarPAuhn9ILdbh4U4mdKuDRwuleOLuwvaSnqs9TTiR` becomes `Password123`
